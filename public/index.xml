      <description>Bone broth is excellent not only for humans but also for pets. It can be used as a meal topper or on its own to replace boring and nutrition-less water. Dogs love their kibble when soaked in the bone broth. Generally, New Zealand has only a few bone broth makers who also provide bone broth for our furry friends, we covered them all here.&#xA;The best bone broth for dogs in New Zealand is beef bone broth from PrimaBroth, venison &amp;amp; goat from Raw Essentials, and Roar classic beef bone broth.</description>
