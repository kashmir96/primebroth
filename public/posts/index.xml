      <description>Bone broth is a stock or broth made by simmering animal bones, such as cattle, chicken, or lamb. The bones are slow-cooked with water for hours to extract nourishing compounds like collagen and essential amino acids that are not found in usual pet food or home-cooked food. Bone broth is often used as a cooking component; however, many people prefer to drink it on its own. For pets, it can be added to their food or used on its own.</description>
