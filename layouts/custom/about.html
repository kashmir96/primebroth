                <p>We are Anna and Curtis, the founders of PrimeBroth.</p>
                <p>Throughout our lives, nutrition, health, and fitness have been incredibly important to us. We discovered bone broth during our wellness journey while seeking a natural collagen source to address joint issues from gym training. </p>
                <p>After his joint issues subsided, Curtis, who is dairy-free, was drawn to its high protein content, which is comparable to whey protein, and continued drinking it daily. Anna, following a carnivore diet, found it a tasty and convenient way to get her calories while managing her busy study schedule.</p>
                <p>However, making bone broth ourselves was time-consuming, messy and took up a lot of space. The available options in Christchurch and around New Zealand were highly acidic, watery, and lacked the nutritional strength of our homemade version. </p>
                <p>To offset this we began making large batches to save time, sharing the excess with friends and family, who quickly became loyal customers, buying for themselves and their pets. Our operation has since grown to where we are today.</p>
                <p>Try it today and discover what all the fuss is about!</p>
