                            <p>How to use your bone broth for pets as a food topper.</p>
                            <p>1. Scrape off the fat cap (we purposely leave this on for added freshness).</p>
                            <p>3. Measure out 30ml to 100ml of bone broth depending on the size of your animal.</p>
                            <p>4. Optional, if you find it more gelatinous than you'd like and would prefer liquid, warm in microwave briefly first (note - this is healthy and normal, due to high collagen content).</p>
                            <p>5. Optional, mix in with water if you want your pets bone broth to go further.</p>
                            <p>6. Pour bone broth onto your pets' biscuits or dinner meal.</p>

                        <p>Our artisanal process involves slow-simmering these carefully chosen bones in small batches, allowing them to release their rich collagen, minerals, and nutrients into the broth. This gentle cooking method ensures that every sip of PrimeBroth is bursting with flavor and packed with the nourishing benefits your body craves.</p>
                    
                        <p>But our commitment to excellence doesn't stop there. After hours of simmering, the broth is meticulously strained and cooled to perfection, preserving its natural integrity and depth of flavor. The result? A velvety-smooth liquid gold that embodies the essence of comfort and well-being.</p>
