                            <p>Our bone broth is uniquely dense, setting it apart from many other brands in New Zealand that tend to dilute their products. The rich, gelatinous texture of our broth is a clear indicator of its high quality gained from extra simmering time and careful choosing of the bones. Furthermore, we maintain a balanced acidity by avoiding the common practice of adding large amounts of apple cider vinegar, which can overshadow the broth’s robust, meaty flavour.</p>
