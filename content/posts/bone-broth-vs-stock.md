## **1. Ingredients—What Goes into Bone Broth vs Stock?**  

### Bone Broth:  
- Made by **simmering animal bones** (often with **marrow**) for **12–24 hours**.  
- Includes **collagen-rich joints**, **ligaments**, and **tendons** to extract **gelatin** and **minerals**.  
- Often enhanced with **vinegar** to release **calcium**, **magnesium**, and **phosphorus** from bones.  
- May include **vegetables**, **herbs**, and **spices** for flavor.  

### Stock:  
- Simmered for a **shorter time** (usually 2–6 hours).  
- Often made with **meat scraps** and **bones** but doesn’t include **collagen-rich joints**.  
- Typically focuses on **flavor** rather than **nutritional value**.  
- Less emphasis on extracting **minerals** or **gelatin**.  

**Key Difference:** Bone broth is **nutrient-dense** and designed for **health benefits**, while stock is primarily for **cooking flavor**.

## **2. Cooking Time—Why It Matters**  
Bone broth’s **long simmering process** allows it to extract **collagen**, **amino acids**, and **minerals** from bones, creating a **nutrient-rich liquid**.  

**Bone Broth Cooking Time:**  
- **12–24 hours** to fully break down bones and release nutrients.  

**Stock Cooking Time:**  
- **2–6 hours**, resulting in a **weaker nutrient profile** and **less gelatin**.  

**Why It Matters:** Bone broth delivers **more nutrients**, while stock is better for **quick recipes**.

### Bone Broth:  
- **Collagen and Gelatin** – Supports **gut health**, **skin elasticity**, and **joint repair**.  
- **Amino Acids** – Helps with **inflammation** and **muscle recovery**.  
- **Minerals** – Provides **calcium**, **magnesium**, and **potassium** for **bone strength** and **hydration**.  
- **Protein-Rich** – Ideal for **post-workout recovery** or **intermittent fasting**.  

### Stock:  
- **Minimal Collagen** – Doesn’t form the **gelatin** that gives bone broth its **healing properties**.  
- **Lower Nutrient Density** – Provides **flavor** but fewer **health benefits**.
