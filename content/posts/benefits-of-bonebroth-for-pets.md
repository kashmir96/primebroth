Bone broth is a stock or broth made by simmering animal bones, such as cattle, chicken, or lamb. The bones are slow-cooked with water for hours to extract nourishing compounds like collagen and essential amino acids that are not found in usual pet food or home-cooked food.

Bone broth is often used as a cooking component; however, many people prefer to drink it on its own. For pets, it can be added to their food or used on its own. Bone broth can be confused with stock, which is a different product. Generally, bone broth is simmered for a more extended period (12 - 48 hours), and it includes bones. Stock is usually cooked for 4 - 6 hours, and it mainly contains meat. Hence, it’s also more nutritious as everything was extracted during the prolonged cooking. 

## Benefits of Bone Broth for Dogs and Cats

Bones and marrow are excellent protein sources, which is your furry friend's primary need. Dogs are active animals with a body structure that has to be provided with enough protein to maintain both a healthy inside and outside. Rich in collagen, which is an important protein, bone broth is a great health supplement for dogs.

Bone broth has many health benefits both for humans and pets; below are some key advantages of incorporating bone broth into your pet's diet:

- **Joint Healing:** Because bone broth is rich in collagen and other nutrients, older dogs or dogs with joint problems can greatly benefit from it. In particular, bone broth contains glucosamine, chondroitin, and hyaluronic acid, which are known for their joint protective and elastic qualities.

- **Gut Support:** Who wouldn’t need gut support? Due to gelatin, glycine and proline, bone broth is very soothing for the gut. It also promotes a healthy gut environment. Bone broth benefits pets with sensitive stomachs or digestive issues, such as leaky gut syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease.

- **Hydration:** Bone broth is an excellent way to keep pets hydrated, especially for those who may not drink enough water. The broth's high water content ensures they stay hydrated, which is crucial for their overall health and well-being.

- **Skin and Coat Health:** The collagen in bone broth can contribute to healthy skin and a shiny coat by supporting the structure and elasticity of the skin.

- **Add Nutrition:** Some pets' food can be pretty low in nutrition. Bone broth, whether it’s in powder or liquid form, is a great way to add nutrients to your pet’s diet. 

- **Improved Appetite:** For pets that are picky eaters or have a reduced appetite due to illness or stress, bone broth can be an appealing addition to their diet. Its rich flavor can stimulate appetite and encourage eating.

Keep in mind that human bone broth isn’t a good solution for pets as it contains high amounts of sodium. It’s always better to purchase a pet’s bone broth from a trusted brand such as <a class="bluelink" href="/shop">PrimalPantry</a> or make it yourself. 

## Conclusion

Incorporating bone broth into your pet’s diet can offer a multitude of health benefits, from joint support and improved digestion to enhanced skin and coat health.
