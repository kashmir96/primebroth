## **Why Does Tallow Balm Go Grainy? (And Why Ours Doesn’t)**  

If you’ve used **tallow balm NZ**, you may have come across some that feel **grainy or uneven**. It’s a common issue, and people making tallow balms in NZ will often tell you it’s **normal**. While the balm still works, graininess **doesn’t have to happen**.  

At **PrimalCare**, we’ve refined our process to ensure **a consistently smooth, whipped texture**. And if your balm ever arrives grainy, we’ll refund you—our **Grain-Free Guarantee** means you never have to settle for rough, uneven balm.

### **1. Why Do Some Tallow Balms Go Grainy?**  

Tallow balm can go grainy when **the fats cool at different rates**, forming **tiny, solidified crystals**. This usually happens because:  

- **The balm wasn’t properly whipped** → When tallow is just melted and poured, it can solidify unevenly.  
- **Temperature changes during storage** → If the balm warms up and then cools too slowly, grains can form.  
- **Batch inconsistency** → Small-scale batches often lack the controlled processing needed to prevent graininess.  

💡 **People making tallow balms in NZ may say:**  
- “It’s just part of using a natural product.”  
- “Rub it in your hands and it will melt.”  
- “All tallow balms do this.”  

💡 **The truth:** Properly whipped tallow balm **doesn’t** have to be grainy.

### **2. Why Our Balm Stays Smooth**  

We use a **whipped, carefully controlled process** to ensure a light, airy, and grain-free texture.  

✔ **Whipped, not just melted** → This prevents uneven cooling that leads to grain formation.  
✔ **Even cooling process** → Tallow sets properly, avoiding crystal formation.  
✔ **Strict quality checks** → Every batch is tested for smoothness before packaging.

### **3. How to Store Tallow Balm to Keep It Smooth**  

Even though our balm is **whipped for stability**, proper storage helps maintain its texture.  

✔ **Keep it at a steady room temperature** → Avoid extreme heat or cold.  
✔ **Don’t leave it in a hot car** → If it melts and re-cools slowly, grains can form.  
✔ **Store in a cool, dry place** → Away from direct sunlight or fluctuating temperatures.  

💡 **If your balm ever arrives grainy, we’ll refund you—our Grain-Free Guarantee means you always get the best quality.**
