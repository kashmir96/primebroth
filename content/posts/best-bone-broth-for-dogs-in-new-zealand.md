Bone broth is excellent not only for humans but also for pets. It can be used as a meal topper or on its own to replace boring and nutrition-less water. Dogs love their kibble when soaked in the bone broth. Generally, New Zealand has only a few bone broth makers who also provide bone broth for our furry friends, we covered them all here.

The best bone broth for dogs in New Zealand is beef bone broth from PrimaBroth, venison & goat from Raw Essentials, and Roar classic beef bone broth.

Bone broth is known to be good for digestion, joints, coat, and sleep. Bone broth also makes a great addition to dry dog kibble. It adds nutrition and flavor. For example, if your dog or cat has a sensitive stomach, joint or digestive issues, or is a picky eater, bone broth can be a great addition to their diet.
