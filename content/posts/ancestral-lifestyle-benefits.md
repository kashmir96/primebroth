## What Problems Are People Solving by Living Ancestrally?  
Modern life is fast-paced, and with it comes a host of **health issues** caused by **processed foods**, **sedentary habits**, and **environmental toxins**. Many people are turning to **ancestral lifestyles** as a way to **reclaim health**, **reduce inflammation**, and **restore balance** through **natural living principles**.  

Living ancestrally means embracing **whole foods**, **natural fats**, and **nourishing skincare**, while avoiding **synthetics** and **refined ingredients**. From **gut health** to **mental clarity**, the ancestral approach offers solutions rooted in **tradition** and **proven practices**.

## **Key Problems the Ancestral Lifestyle Addresses**  

### 1. Chronic Inflammation  
Modern diets high in **seed oils**, **refined sugars**, and **processed foods** trigger **inflammation**, which is linked to conditions like **arthritis**, **autoimmune diseases**, and **eczema**.  

**Ancestral diets** eliminate these triggers and focus on **anti-inflammatory foods** like:  
- **Bone Broth**: Packed with **collagen** and **gelatin** to **heal the gut** and reduce inflammation.  
- **Healthy Animal Fats**: Including **tallow** and **ghee**, which provide **omega-3 fatty acids** to fight inflammation.  

### 2. Gut Health Issues  
Poor gut health is linked to **digestive problems**, **food sensitivities**, and **immune dysfunction**. Processed foods and **additives** disrupt the **gut microbiome**, leading to **leaky gut syndrome**.  

**Ancestral foods** like **bone broth** help **seal the gut lining** and **promote good bacteria**, supporting digestion and **nutrient absorption**.  

---

### 3. Nutritional Deficiencies  
Many modern diets lack **vitamins**, **minerals**, and **amino acids** due to **soil depletion** and **food processing**. This leads to **low energy**, **weakened immunity**, and **poor skin health**.  

**Ancestral foods** focus on **nutrient-dense options** such as:  
- **Organ Meats**: High in **iron**, **vitamin A**, and **B vitamins**.  
- **Bone Broth**: Rich in **minerals** and **collagen** for **bone strength** and **joint support**.  
- **[Tallow Balm NZ](https://primalpantry.co.nz/shop/products/tallow-skin/).**: Provides **vitamins A, D, E, and K** for **skin repair** and **hydration**.  

---

### 4. Skin Problems  
Conventional skincare products often include **harsh chemicals**, **fragrances**, and **preservatives** that can cause **irritation**, **dryness**, and **eczema**.  

Ancestral skincare—like **PrimalCare Tallow Balm**—offers **chemical-free hydration** with **bioavailable nutrients** that **absorb deeply** into the skin. Its **whipped, non-grainy formula** is perfect for sensitive skin, leaving it **soft**, **hydrated**, and **nourished**.  

---

### 5. Hormonal Imbalances  
Processed foods and **low-fat diets** disrupt **hormonal balance**, impacting **energy**, **mood**, and **metabolism**.  

**Healthy fats** in ancestral diets provide the building blocks for **hormone production**. **Bone broth**, **tallow**, and **olive oil** support **hormonal health** and **reduce stress**.

## **How Ancestral Living Improves Health**  
To keep things simple, let's continue with bone broth and tallow balm as our examples for ancestral products (which are just a couple of many many options). These products are great for: 

### 1. Supports Joint Health  
**Collagen-rich bone broth** improves **joint mobility** and reduces **pain** by replenishing **cartilage**. It also supports **tissue repair** and **muscle recovery**.  

### 2. Enhances Skin Hydration  
**Tallow balm**, rich in **fat-soluble vitamins**, nourishes and **repairs skin barriers**, making it ideal for those suffering from **dryness**, **eczema**, and **scarring**.  

### 3. Promotes Better Digestion  
The **gelatin** in **bone broth** binds to water, improving digestion and **gut health**. It’s particularly effective for **leaky gut syndrome** and **bloating**.  

### 4. Reduces Stress and Anxiety  
**Healthy fats** and **amino acids** in ancestral foods help produce **neurotransmitters** like **serotonin**, improving **mood** and **mental clarity**.
