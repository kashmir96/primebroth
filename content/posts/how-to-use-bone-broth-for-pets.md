## Ways you can implement bone broth for your dog’s or cat’s diet

Bone broth can serve as a nutrient-rich addition to your pet’s diet. Broth can be served warm or cold, on its own or with your pet's meal. But remember to never heat raw food products containing whole or minced bone. If you want to make your own broth at home, check out our recipe.

### Serve as-is

Giving your pet bone broth the first time this way might be ideal. All you have to do is take the bone broth from the freezer and place it in the fridge until defrosted. Once defrosted, pour a bit into your pet’s bowl and voila! A happy, healthy, hydrated dog or cat awaits.

### Add bone broth to meals - appetite enhancer

Warm weather often causes dogs and cats to lose their appetite. Bone broth offers a tasty, nutritious alternative that keeps them hydrated and can encourage them to start eating again. Especially if you are currently feeding kibble and can only afford to add supplements, adding bone broth to kibble or dry food during meal time will help tremendously with digestion (to help digest difficult-to-digest carbs), lack of nutrients, and hydration (since kibble lacks intracellular moisture). Just pour (or sprinkle) a small amount of bone broth over your pet's regular food to enhance flavor and nutrition. Adding the broth to kibble or raw food will give them a boost of gut and joint support.

Simply feed them a little bone broth and see if this tempts them to tuck into their usual food. For those who still don’t want to eat, read our guides, packed with simple methods to help your dog not eating or cat not eating.

### Make frozen treats

Sometimes it’s hard to store bone broth without defrosting the whole package, e.g., jar. An excellent solution to it is to freeze liquid broth in ice cubes or in the form of lollies. You can feed it to your dog straight as a treat or defrost it in the microwave to use as a meal topper. Nutritious meaty ice cubes are perfect on a warm day as a cool addition to a pet's meal. Either as a snack or meal topper, it can make their food more exciting.

Here are the instructions for bone broth ice cubes/lollies:
1. Place bone broth into an ice cube tray or lolly molds.
2. Leave them in the freezer for a few hours or leave them until needed.

### Use instead of water

If your pet struggles to drink enough water during the day, bone broth could be a good solution. For example, you can add bone broth to their water. The strong aroma of the beef is irresistible and makes drinking water enjoyable.

### Make portable gummies

Gummies are perfect if you want to feed bone broth to your pet on the go. Portable gummies are easy to make and carry around and can be used in various ways, e.g., healthy snack, treat, or training aid.

For bone broth gummies, you will need:
- 200 ml of bone broth
- 4 tablespoons gelatine powder or 4 x leaf sheets
- Small amount of liver for taste (optional)

How to make bone broth gummies:
1. Stir bone broth with the gelatine. Leave to sit for 3-5 minutes.
2. If adding berries or liver, blend them until fully combined into a smoothie-like texture.
3. Heat the bone broth and gelatine mixture over low heat, stirring occasionally until the gelatine has melted.
4. If you are adding blended berry and liver mixture, add this to the pan and continue to mix well over a low heat.
5. Once the mixture has a smooth consistency, pour it into small silicone molds or an ice cube tray.
6. Pop into the fridge and cool until firm, approx. 5-6 hours.
7. Remove the gummies from the molds and watch your pet enjoy them.

### Use as a training aid

Beef bone broth is so delicious that you can use it as a healthy training treat! Frozen bone broth ice cubes or portable gummies are perfect for it.

## How much bone broth should you feed to your dog?

It’s also important not to overfeed your pet bone broth so they won’t eat anything else. We recommend adjusting the serving size based on your dog’s size. For a liquid broth, follow this rule:
- Small dogs (less than 10 kg) - 30 ml
- Medium dogs (10-35 kg) - 60 ml
- Large dogs (35 kg +) - 120 ml

You can feed about 150 ml of bone broth a day to your dog.

For bone broth powder, we recommend:
- Small dogs (less than 10 kg) - ½ tsp
- Medium dogs (10-35 kg) - 1 tsp
- Big dogs (35 kg +) - 1½ - 2 tsp
