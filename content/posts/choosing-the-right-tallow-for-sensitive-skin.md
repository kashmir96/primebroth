## Choosing the Right Tallow for Sensitive Skin  

Not all **tallow balms** are the same. If you have **sensitive skin, eczema, or allergies**, choosing the **right** tallow is key to avoiding irritation.  

---

### **1. Suet-Based Tallow Is the Best for Sensitive Skin**  

✔ Comes from the **kidney fat of grass-fed cows** → The purest form of tallow.  
✔ Naturally **white, odorless, and rich in nutrients**.  
❌ Avoid **dripping-based tallow**, which is often greasy and yellow.  

💡 **Only use suet-based beef tallow for skin NZ** to avoid **impurities and irritation**.

### **2. Avoid Added Fragrances & Essential Oils (If Needed)**  

✔ For extra-sensitive skin → Choose **unscented tallow balm**.  
✔ If using essential oils → Stick to **gentle ones like lavender or chamomile**.  

💡 **Best for babies and ultra-sensitive skin?** **Neutral, fragrance-free tallow balm is safest.**
