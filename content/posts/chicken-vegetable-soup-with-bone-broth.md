## Ingredients:

- 4 cups chicken bone broth
- 2 cups cooked shredded chicken (leftover rotisserie chicken works well)
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup diced tomatoes (canned or fresh)
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Optional: chopped fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions:

1. **Sauté Vegetables**: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté for about 5 minutes until the vegetables start to soften.

3. **Pour in Chicken Bone Broth**: Pour in the chicken bone broth into the pot. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.

5. **Add Chicken**: Once the vegetables are tender, add the shredded chicken and diced tomatoes to the pot. Stir well and let it simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes until heated through.

6. **Season to Taste**: Taste the soup and season with salt and pepper according to your preference. Adjust the seasoning as needed.
