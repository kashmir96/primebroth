## How Does Tallow Balm Not Go Rancid?—Stability and Shelf Life Explained  
One of the most common questions about **tallow balm** is, “How does it avoid going **rancid** without artificial **preservatives**?” The answer lies in the **natural properties** of tallow and its **fatty acid composition**, which make it **inherently stable**.

## **1. What Makes Tallow Naturally Stable?**  
Tallow is primarily composed of **saturated fats**, which are highly **resistant to oxidation**—the process that causes oils to turn **rancid**.  

### **Key Reasons for Stability:**  
1. **High Saturated Fat Content:** Saturated fats are **chemically stable**, meaning they don’t break down easily when exposed to **air**, **light**, or **heat**.  
2. **Low Polyunsaturated Fat Levels:** Unlike plant-based oils high in **polyunsaturated fats**, tallow contains very few of these, making it less likely to **oxidize** quickly.  
3. **Natural Antioxidants:** Tallow retains **vitamin E**, a natural **antioxidant** that protects against **free radical damage** and slows the **oxidation process**.

## **2. Does Tallow Balm Need Preservatives?**  
Unlike many **water-based lotions**, which require **preservatives** to prevent **mold** and **bacteria growth**, tallow balm is **oil-based**.  

### **Why Tallow Balm is Self-Preserving:**  
- **No Water Content:** Bacteria and mold typically grow in **water**, which tallow balm doesn’t contain.  
- **Oil-Based Formulation:** Fats naturally resist microbial growth, making them **inherently safer**.  
- **Antioxidant Protection:** The addition of oils like **jojoba** and **olive oil** in PrimalCare’s formula enhances **stability** further.

### **Typical Shelf Life:**  
- **6–12 months** when stored in a **cool, dry place** away from **direct sunlight**.  
- Can last even **longer** if kept in a **refrigerator**, though refrigeration isn’t required.  

### **Signs of Spoilage:**

- **Unusual Smell:** A strong, **sour odor** instead of a **neutral scent**.  
- **Discoloration:** Dark spots or **yellowing** not present when new.
