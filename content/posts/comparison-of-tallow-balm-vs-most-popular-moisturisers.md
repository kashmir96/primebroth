## Comparison of Tallow Balm vs Most Popular Moisturisers  

Many people assume **moisturisers** are all the same, but there’s a **big difference** between **tallow balm NZ** and mainstream store-bought creams. Let’s compare.  

---

### **1. What’s in Your Moisturiser?**  

Most store-bought moisturisers contain:  
❌ **Petroleum-based ingredients** – Forms a barrier but doesn’t truly hydrate.  
❌ **Synthetic preservatives & parabens** – Linked to skin irritation.  
❌ **Water as a main ingredient** – Evaporates quickly, requiring frequent reapplication.  

In contrast, **tallow balm for skin** is:  
✔ **100% natural** – No preservatives, fillers, or synthetic chemicals.  
✔ **Made from beef tallow** – Mimics human skin oils for deep absorption.  
✔ **Rich in vitamins A, D, E, and K** – Helps repair and nourish the skin naturally.

### **2. How Well Do They Moisturise?**  

✔ **Tallow Balm** → Absorbs deeply, providing **long-lasting** hydration.  
✔ **Popular Moisturisers** → Often water-based, requiring constant reapplication.  

💡 **If you have eczema, psoriasis, or very dry skin, tallow balm NZ will keep your skin moisturised for hours, unlike standard creams.**
