## How Is Tallow Balm Made?  

Tallow balm is a **simple but effective** moisturizer made from **beef tallow**, blended with nourishing oils. However, not all **tallow balm NZ** products are made the same wayâ€”quality depends on the ingredients and process used.  

### What Is Tallow Balm Made Of?  

A good **tallow balm** contains only a few key ingredients:  

- **Beef tallow** (from suet, not dripping)  
- **Olive oil** â€“ Softens the balm and boosts hydration.  
- **Jojoba oil** â€“ Lightens the texture and balances skin oils.  
- **Essential oils** (optional, for skin benefits and scent).  

### The Process of Making Tallow Balm  

1. **Rendering the tallow** â€“ The raw beef fat is slowly melted down to remove impurities.  
2. **Straining** â€“ The liquid fat is filtered multiple times for purity.  
3. **Mixing with oils** â€“ Jojoba and olive oil are added for a smoother consistency.  
4. **Adding essential oils** â€“ If used, essential oils are blended in.  
5. **Whipping** â€“ The mixture is whipped for a light, creamy texture.  
6. **Cooling & Packaging** â€“ The balm is poured into jars and left to set.  

### Home-Based vs. Commercial Production  

Many **small-scale tallow balm NZ** makers produce their balms in home kitchens. While homemade skincare can feel personal, there are risks. These small-batch balms are often made in **less sterile environments**, increasing the chance of contamination. For people with **eczema, psoriasis, or sensitive skin**, this can be a problemâ€”**even tiny bacteria or mold can trigger irritation or infection**.  

At **PrimalCare**, we make **tallow balm in a commercial food-grade kitchen**, ensuring **hygiene, safety, and consistency**. This means:  

âœ” **No risk of contamination** â€“ Everything is made in a sterile environment.  
âœ” **Larger batches = More affordable prices** â€“ Home-based balms are often expensive due to small-scale production.  
âœ” **Consistent texture and quality** â€“ No grainy or uneven balm.
